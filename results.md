#Results

1. The range of values go from a 100% decrease in coal use(Massachusetts) to a 
27% increase (Alaska).

2. The large overall drop seems to be motivated by some northeastern states with 
large decreases (Massachusetts: 100%, New York: 98%, New Jersey: 91%, 
Connecticut: 99%) and California, 90%.

3. Differences could be based on pipeline access to cheaper natural gas. The 
shale gas revolution occured during this time period, with reserves and pipelines 
located in areas that showed large declines.

4. States with large declines (NY, CA, MA) also have strong Renewable Portfolio
Standards, which incentivize renewable energy over coal.

5. States with the smallest decreases (Wyoming: 12%, West Virginia: 7%), or Alaska 
which increased its coal use by 27%, all have coal reserves in-state. Coal might
be especially important to thier state economies.
